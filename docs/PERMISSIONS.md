#####Storage Justification
Sync storage is used to application data that can be synced across browser instances.

#####Tabs Justification
I'm using tabs permission to let user go back to 
1. Default new tab.
2. Bookmarks page
3. Apps page.

When user wants to go back to one these three pages. App replaces current new tab (app home page) with request browser page (new tab/bookmarks/apps).
