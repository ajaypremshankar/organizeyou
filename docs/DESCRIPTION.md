In times when being remote is not luxury but a necessity, it is easy to get distracted on the agenda for the day. How will you keep track of things that needs to be done today? How can you focus on the top 3 things that you need to work on the day? Well, you can write on a whiteboard or paper and look at it. But, distraction is kind-of a devil who'll make you forget to look at the list.

Presenting to you,
OrganizeYou, 
it is an extension/add-on for your browser and it replaces your new tab. It keeps todo for the day in front of you all the time. Idea is to keep adding tasks as minimalist as possible.

Apps are just mean to help humans. They shouldn't control our lives. OrganizeYou is one such app, and will remain to be so.
