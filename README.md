##OrganizeYou
In times when being remote is not luxury but a necessity, 
it is easy to get distracted on agenda for the day. How will you keep track of things that needs to be done today? How can you focus on top 3 things that you need to work on the day? Well, you can write on whiteboard or a paper and look at it.
But, distraction is kind-of a devil who'll make you forget to look at the list.

We might have solution for it. What if we keep your 3 most important stuff in-front you, well, almost all the time.

So, 
####What is OrganizeYou?

**OrganizeYou** is an extension/add-on for your browser and it replaces your new tab. It keeps todo for the day in-front you all the time. Idea is to keep adding tasks as minimalist as possible. 

####Why OrganizeYou?

There are many apps that can keep your todos. 
Most of them are either,
 1. Do too many things - hence it is complex to use or maintain them.
 2. Or, they keep todos within the app - so you have to remember checking what you need to work on.

OrganizeYou solves both the problems. It is minimalistic and it stays in-front of you all day.
We build it to solve the problem that we were facing.
